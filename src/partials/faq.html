            Absolutely. Natty Lean is made with 100% natural ingredients and is
            manufactured in the USA in an FDA-registered facility that follows
            Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). However, as with any supplement,
            it's a good idea to consult your healthcare provider before
            starting.
